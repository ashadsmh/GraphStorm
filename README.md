# GraphStorm: A GPU-Accelerated Graph Algorithm Project

This project demonstrates how CUDA parallel programming can accelerate classical graph algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) compared to CPU implementations. It includes CPU baselines (BFS, DFS, A*) and a CUDA BFS kernel, with benchmark results on automated graphs.

# Features
- CUDA BFS implementation  
- CPU baselines for **BFS, DFS, A***  
- Synthetic graph generator + test cases  
- Benchmark results (CPU vs GPU speedup)  
- Visualizations of search expansions  
- Clean, production-ready repo structure
