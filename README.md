# GraphStorm: A GPU-Accelerated Graph Algorithm Project

This project demonstrates how CUDA parallel programming can accelerate classical graph algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) compared to CPU implementations. It includes CPU baselines (BFS, DFS, A*) and a CUDA BFS kernel, with benchmark results on automated graphs.
